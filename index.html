                            <p>Worst experience I've had with an auto shop. They diagnosed my check engine light as a major engine problem and quoted $2,500. Took it to the dealer and it was just a faulty sensor - $150 fix. They either don't know what they're doing or are dishonest. Either way, avoid this place.</p>
